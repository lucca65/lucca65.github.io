Hi!

Welcome to my personal blog, âš›ï¸Ž AtomicBit

Here you are going to see a lot of programming ðŸ’», some philosophy ãˆ», one or other thing about plants ðŸŒ± and maybe other stuff too

I'm a battle hardened programmer with some knowledge on Elixir, Ethereum, Ruby, C# and a few more. Deeply interested in human questions such as philosophy and our future relation with machines and code, I'm currently focusing on Blockchain technologies.

I also help out on the organization on ELUG, our Elixir community on SÃ£o Paulo.


Please feel free to follow me on [Github](github.com/lucca65)!
